        <p>Robin is arguably the most famous superhero sidekick in comic book history. Bob Kane, Bill Finger, and Jerry Robinson originally created Robin back in 1940 in an attempt to draw in a younger demographic. It worked, and Batman comic book sales almost doubled.</p>
        <p>Bruce Wayne losing his parents at a young age not only traumatized him but also caused him to be raised without a mother-and-father family structure. This explains why Bruce thought it was a good idea to take an eight-year-old Dick Grayson and let him fight crime as his sidekick Robin. Dick would continue his career as Robin for decades. In comic book time, this was through his college days at Hudson University.</p>
